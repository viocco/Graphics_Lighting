Overall Plan:
1. Create a 3D Camera (orthographic and perspective)
	i) modify vertex shader in lib1 to be multiplied by view matrix 
2. Create projection for that camera
	i) modify vertex shader in lib1 to be multiplied by persptive matrix
	ii) modify vertex shader in lib1 to be multiplied by orthogonal matrix  
	Question: How do we do this all at once?
3. set viewport before we draw (might not need this the way we already coded)????
5. Make a four jointed object
6. Make a floor



Completed:
1) Change all rotations to quaternion rotations (all other transformations remain the same)
